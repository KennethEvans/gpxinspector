<h1 align="center">GPX Inspector</h1>
<p>GPX Inspector is an application that allows you to view and manage GPX files.  It also has the feature of  letting you see your tracks, routes, and waypoints in Google Earth.</p>
<p> GPX Inspector is is based on <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and requires Java to be installed. You should be able to get Java <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">here</a>. You install it by unzipping the files into some directory and uninstall it by removing them. It does not use the Windows registry. You run it from its executable, GpxInspector.exe on Windows or GpxInspector on UNIX systems. It is currently only available for Windows, primarily owing to a lack of available test machines for other platforms.</p>
<p>It should read GPX 1.0 or GPX 1.1  file format versions, but uses GPX 1.1 for internal use and saving. </p>
<p> The main part of the interface is a tree view, which consists of all the files you have loaded and the tracks, routes, and waypoints in them. You can expand or contract the tree, and other options are available by right clicking a tree item. You can drag and drop GPX files to the tree view. You can select all visible items in the tree with Ctrl-A.</p>
<p>Note that most of the user interface elements, such as buttons, text entries, checkboxes, etc., have tool tips which should appear when you hold the cursor over them. This is the easiest way to get help on what these controls do. </p>
<h2>Menus</h2>
<h3>File Menu </h3>
<h4>New GPX File</h4>
<p>Creates a new GPX file. </p>
<h4>Open GPX File</h4>
<p>Brings up a file dialog to open GPX files.  You can select multiple files. They will then appear in the tree. There is also an icon at the top of the tree view to do this. </p>
<h4>Save Selected GPX Files... </h4>
<p>Brings up a dialog to save files. The ones that have been changed are checked when the dialog comes up. You can change the check marks and decide whether to use Save (saves the file under the same name without prompting) or Save As (brings up a File Selection Dialog so you can choose a different name). You can also Do Nothing or Reset the dialog to how it came up as well as Check All or Check None of the files to be saved. </p>
<h4>Save KML</h4>
<p>Creates a KML file using the loaded files that are checked.  There is a dialog to specify options.  Optionally you can send the KML file to Google Earth.
  See <a href="#KML">KML</a> for more information. There is also an icon at the top of the tree view to do this. </p>
<h4> Find Near</h4>
<p>Brings up a dialog that lets you choose find options.  On clicking OK, it sets the check mark on only the files already loaded that match the criteria.
  Optionally you can choose whether to remove items that do not match. See <a href="#FindNear">Find Near</a> for more information. </p>
<h4>Find Files Near</h4>
Similar to find files, excepts that it searches a specified directory and loads any files that have a element (waypoint or trackpoint) that matches the criterion. You can choose whether only the matching items in the files are left or whether all items are left. If only the matching items are left, the file will be marked as modified. <span class="style1">Be careful of saving it as any existing non-matching items will be lost.</span> See <a href="#FindNear">Find Near</a> for more information.
